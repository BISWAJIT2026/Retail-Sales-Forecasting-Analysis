📊 **Retail Sales Forecasting Analysis**

📝 **Project Overview**

Accurate retail sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize **inventory management, marketing strategies, and pricing decisions.**
This project applies **exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning, and deep learning models** to predict retail sales while uncovering key business insights.

🎯 **Objectives**

* Predict future **Units Sold** and **Sales Revenue (USD)**.
* Evaluate multiple ML models to identify the most accurate forecasting method.
* Analyze the **impact of discounts, marketing spend, holidays, and seasonal trends**.
* Provide **business insights** for inventory planning and strategy optimization.
